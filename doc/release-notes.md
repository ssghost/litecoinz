Negative confirmations and conflict detection
---------------------------------------------

The wallet will now report a negative number for confirmations that indicates
how deep in the block chain the conflict is found. For example, if a transaction
A has 5 confirmations and spends the same input as a wallet transaction B, B
will be reported as having -5 confirmations. If another wallet transaction C
spends an output from B, it will also be reported as having -5 confirmations.
To detect conflicts with historical transactions in the chain a one-time
`-rescan` may be needed.

Unlike earlier versions, unconfirmed but non-conflicting transactions will never
get a negative confirmation count. They are not treated as spendable unless
they're coming from ourself (change) and accepted into our local mempool,
however. The new "trusted" field in the `listtransactions` RPC output
indicates whether outputs of an unconfirmed transaction are considered
spendable.

### Logging

- The log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. "2018-02-28T12:34:56Z").

### ZMQ

- The new RPC `getzmqnotifications` returns information about active ZMQ
  notifications.
